# Facebook-Comment-Volume-Prediction

The purpose of this project was to predict how many comments a user-generated post is expected to receive in the given set of hours. We have modeled the user comments pattern over a set of variables which are provided and tried to get the right number of comments for each post with minimum error possible and finally derive meaningful insights for effective marketing strategies.
