# Facebook-Comment-Volume-Prediction
The purpose of this project is to predict how many comments a user-generated post is expected to receive in the given set of hours. We need to model the user comments pattern over a set of variables which are provided and get to the right number of comments for each post with minimum error possible and finally derive meaningful insights for effective marketing strategies.
